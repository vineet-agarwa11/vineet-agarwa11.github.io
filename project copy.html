								<header class="major">
									<h1>Biological Associations</h1>
									<p>The relationships between subjects’ biological demographic information, such as age, sex, and health outcome, and extracted CC shape metrics from clean segmentations were analyzed to evaluate which features are most biologically meaningful. Regression and classification models were trained to predict age and neuropsychological health status, respectively. Different feature selection techniques were performed for each association and common relevant features selected in all generally tended to be thickness, curve, and Witelson5 sectioning metrics.<br>
